# Talaria

This is a bot that scans messages of any channel it is added to, and responds accordingly:

- If the JIRA ticket prefixes DEV- , PP- , SC- , or ASIAQNT- are conatined within the message, Talaria will respond with a link to the corresponding JIRA ticket. It does not matter what case the prefixes are in (dev- , DEV- , and dEv- will all work the same).
