This bot depends on Slack's python API: https://github.com/slackapi/python-slack-events-api

How to setup a server to run the app:

Clone, build, and install the the API repo, and create a virtualenv inside the api folder.

You will need the slack signing secret and slack bot token, which I can send to you directly. Once you have them, you can add them to the $ENV/bin/activate file.

Then, source $ENV/bin/activate.

Finally, run my app.py with python.
